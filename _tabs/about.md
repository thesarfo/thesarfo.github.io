### Welcome

Iâ€™m a software engineer from Ghana (ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­) who likes to build software that doesnâ€™t suck.
This is where I share my thoughts on software, tech, and whatever else I feel like talking about at the time. 

You can also find me on  [Github](https://www.github.com/thesarfo) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ernest-sarfo). Or, if you're old-school, you can send me an [email](mailto:workswsarfo@gmail.com)

Oh, and Iâ€™m open to freelance workâ€”so if you need someone to help build something solid, letâ€™s talk!
