I'm a software engineer from Ghana (ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­) who likes to build software that doesn't suck.
This is where I share my thoughts on software engineering and whatever else I feel like talking about at the time.

I'm mostly interested in distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and cognitive science, pretty much anything that explores how tech meets human behaviour

You can find me on  [Github](https://www.github.com/thesarfo) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ernest-sarfo). Or, if you're old-school, you can send me an [email](mailto:workswsarfo@gmail.com)

Oh, and Iâ€™m open to freelance work, so if you need someone to help build something solid, letâ€™s talk!
