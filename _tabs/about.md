### Welcome

I'm Ernest Sarfo, a Software Engineer from Ghana(ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­) who likes to write software that doesn't suck.

Here is where I publish my thoughts on software and other things.

You can also find me on online places like [Github](https://www.github.com/thesarfo) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ernest-sarfo). Or, if you're old-school, you can send me an [email](mailto:workswsarfo@gmail.com)

Oh, and I'm available for hire or freelancing work!
